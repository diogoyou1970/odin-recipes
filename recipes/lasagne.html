      <li>12 lasagna sheets, softened for 20 seconds in hot water</li>
      <li>50g/0.1lbs of parmesan</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <p><strong>For the ragù</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Heat the oil in a large pan and then add the vegetables and leave to fry for 5 minutes until softened and beginning to color</li>
      <li>Add the mince and pancetta and fry for a minute or two then add the garlic, stock and rosemary and cook until the meat has browned on all sides</li>
      <li>Add the white wine and simmer until slightly reduced before adding the tomatoes and tomato paste</li>
      <li>Leave to simmer either on a low heat on the hob or in a preheated over at 160°C/320°F for at least 1.5-2 hours</li>
    </ol>
      <p><strong>For the béchamel</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Heat the milk and bay leaf until it begins to simmer and then remove from the heat and set aside</li>
      <li>In a separate pan, melt the butter over a medium heat and then add the flour to make a roux then add the milk (slowly at first) whilst stirring constantly</li>
      <li>When you've added all of the milk, continue to stir over heat for about 15 minutes until the sauce becomes really thick</li>
      <li>Remove the bay leaf, season with black pepper and grate in the nutmeg to taste- I like to give it a really good grating</li>
      <li>Mix in the egg yolks, then parmesan and remove from the heat and allow to cool</li>
    </ol>
      <p><strong>For the layers</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Grease a square baking dish and add two sheets of lasagna</li>
      <li>Cover the lasagna with a layer of ragù and then cover that with a layer of béchamel</li>
      <li>Repeat the process until you're out of ragù. If you've got the thicknesses right then you should have enough for 4 decent layers</li>
      <li>Top with a final layer of pasta, béchamel and then sprinkle over the remaining cheese</li>
      <li>Bake in a fan oven at 160C for 45-55 minutes until the cheese is bubbling and golden brown</li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
